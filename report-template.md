## Overview of the Analysis
* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of the analysis is to use various techniques to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of the borrowers. 

* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial information provided are loan size,interest rate,borrower income,debt to income,number of accounts,derogatory marks,total debt,loan status, all these variables used to predict the creditworthiness of the borrower. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
The balanced accuracy score of the model is: 0.9520479254722232


The logistic regression model fits well, nearly perfect with accuracy of 99%

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

The model I would recommend is the logistic regression model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, because it shows that it has 95% on the outcome of borrowers being able to repay their initial loans
